# Microservice Project

## Overview

This repository contains a microservices-based architecture designed to provide a scalable and modular solution for [brief description of the project]. The project is built on [technology stack], leveraging the power of microservices to enhance flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture:** The project is divided into independent microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality. This enables easier development, deployment, and maintenance.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** The entire project can be deployed using Docker containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Service Discovery:** [Explain how service discovery is implemented, e.g., using tools like Consul, Eureka, etc.]
- **API Gateway:** Centralized API Gateway is implemented to manage and route requests to the appropriate microservices, providing a unified entry point for external clients.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrated logging and monitoring solutions for real-time insights into the system's performance and error tracking.
- **Security:** Security measures, including authentication and authorization, are implemented to protect the microservices and ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- spring boot
- mySQL
- Java
